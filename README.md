# freeCodeCamp
	Here is the code when I have been studying on the https://www.freecodecamp.org.
	I was first introduced to computers and software in 2021.
	I would like to thank one of my female classmates who is a computer related major. In the course of communicating with her, the door to the computer world opened to me, and I discovered a new world.
